Scheduling algorithms located at 944 and 971

I am having major issues with my reading of data. I did not finish in time. Please look at scheduling algorithms for partial points, also if possible I can come in on monday to your office hours and show you that I have fixed it. Sorry for the inconvienence, I had it working but ran into issues towards the end of my project and I have no idea where to begin with such little time left.
